# BitGo V1.0

This Library allows you to control our BitGo V1.0, without any problems. Also many thanks to MKleinSB for his MCP23017V1 Library. We've put the link to his repo in our credits. Going forward, the library allows you to fully control our BitGo, using simple functions, such as "get distance", "get Left/Right line sensor", "turn headlights on/off", "drive forward/backward/left/right at speed 0-255", and more.

## Installation

How do I add this Library to my project.
In order to do as such, copy the following url.

```
https://github.com/JEAPI-DEV/BitGo/
```

and when you go to your existing microbit project, or create a new project, and go unter extensions, you will probably see a search bar in there paste the url you copied earlier. And Click on the search result. After that, it should be installed. And you will see our library, on the left side
